The name of the project is AKAN NAMES GENERATOR. This web application deals with Ghanaian names. A user may place the day of their birth,
then the program gives the output of the names. The code utilizes HTML as its structure, which enables it to indicate where the text is positioned.
The CSS allows the structure of the code to attain color and shapes. JavaScript uses the let functions and if statements to calculate the date and months. The following 
equation was used d=((4CC​−2×CC−1)+(45×YY​)+(1026×(MM+1)​)+DD)mod7. CC is the first two digits of the year (e.g., for 1989, CC = 19)
YY is the last two digits of the year (e.g., for 1989, YY = 89)
MM is the month
DD is the day of the month
mod is the modulus operator (%)
In case of any errors, you can use the following code to access the program code and make the necessary corrections.

Given that the user opens the Akan Name Generator. When the user enters their date of birth and selects their gender, 
the system calculates the day of the week they were born, and it displays their Akan name along with the day.
The technologies used were as follows:
a) Visual Studio, which allows one to create the code. It offers a better environment for creating the application.
b) Git Bush allows a user to link the code to the github.
